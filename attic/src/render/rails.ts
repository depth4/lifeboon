 *
 * A railway is still swept from its centreline rather than built as a part.
 * That is deliberate for now: a line is a corridor of its own and shares no
 * ground with the streets, so it has nothing to argue with. When it does —
 * level crossings, tram track embedded in a carriageway — it becomes a part
